Practical 4 :

From the feedback it told me that numbers are not informative.

Therefore, I uploaded the document again to add a more informative commit message.


Practical 5 :
  
  variables.py :
     
     I did not use the boolean example in the script, so I added the "X and Y" examples in the final version.
  
  triangle.py : 
     
     The last triangle was missed because I use range(1,10). It is wrong. I checked it out and replaced it with range(1,11) 
 
 mystery_code.py :
     
     My unclear expression may cause some confusing. The program will create 10 random integers, but it will only output the last value. I correct my expression.
  
  pizza_party :
     
     Feedback told that my pseudocode is lacked, so I rewrite the pseudocode in my script and output it well-documentedly.


Practical 6 :
  
  scatter.py :
   
    I am a bit confused about  "Displays frequency table that matches the input when the input table is changed".
    
    Do you mean we should make a program to replace some elements in list with the things you input? Or it just depends on your synthetic operation?
    
    feedback:
         I created a varable for age that can be modified and returned the correct risk in the new version.
 
 boxplot.py:
      
      I added the labels to it.
      
      I did not make the list sorted. So now I sorted the score by function called "sorted(score)"  
      
      I forgot to calculated and commented on Rob's mark and now I added the process.
