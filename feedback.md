For Practical4, I didn't change the content of the template file, so I added some introduction to myself.

For Practical5, there were no improvements available for the formative feedback.

For Practical6, for the figures of both programs, I did not draw labels, so I added labels. In the program that tallies Rob's grades, I did not sort the list of Rob's grades before outputting it, so I changed the output command to "print(sorted(marks))". The feedback said that I didn't have code to show whether Rob passed the ICA, so I added a judgment statement to compare whether Rob's average score was above 60 and output whether Rob passed the ICA. I uploaded the revised code to the folder Practical6.
