Analysis:
The percentage of identical amino acids between mouse and human is very high, which implies that DLX5 protein is highly conserved across species. Thus DLX5 may be a housekeeping protein that is important for both humans and mice, and it may have a basic function, such as energy production or resistance to viruses. This protein is not specific in a particular species. Moreover, their low similarity compared to random sequences suggests that this human-mouse similarity is not a coincidence.
