# we know the sequence is p=(i*(i+1))/2.
# sum is the amount of the triangle
# i is the number of slice
# the loop began when i equaled 1
# and finished when i reached 10
for i in range(1,11): # repeat the loop for 10 times
    sum = (i*(i+1))/2
    print(sum)
# output the the number of triangles
